2.2.3 - released
------------------
* adding better Individual account protection, by assuming null in settings of Ind Account Name defaults to Individual, 
  and protects account from deletion [greenstork]
* FIXED: OpportunityInstallments had an update call in a for loop, removed and now behold larger batches for data manipulation operations [greenstork]
* FIXED issue where engagement tracker tests fail if Opp Rollup settings rec is not present; also apply namespace-prefix 
  changes to eng tracker so it works in unmanaged gwbase setting [matthew]

2.1.0 - 2.2.2 - released
----------------------

  for opportunities.

* add "Org" prefix to opp rollup fields on Account, to distinguish from contact fields with same names [matthew]
* Engagement Tracker: change pyramid chart on engagement dashboard to draw from new analytic snapshot, rather than 
  from an on-the-fly query.  This is to allow this to work with orgs that have >50k contacts.
* created three new fields for tracking commemoration/tribute gifts on opp, Commemoration Type, Commemoration Special Notes, 
  Commemoration Name and added a contact role of Honoree to Opportunity Contact Role
* Added 4 new fields to contact for rolling up recurring information - Recurring Amount, Recurring Payment Period, Recurring 
  Payment Frequency and Recurring Annualized Amount (calculated formula). Added recurring rollups to OppRollups class and batch process

2.0.11 - released
------------------

* Added ability to force Visualforce pagelet rollups to use calendar year, based on setting - changed all relevant rollup SOQLs to dynamic, added boolean to check for fiscal years.  
  This will not prevent code failure if custom fiscal years are enabled, but you will have to adjust the setting.  We designed this way to prevent an extra SOQL to FiscalYearSettings table.
